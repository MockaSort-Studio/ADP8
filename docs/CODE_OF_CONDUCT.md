About This Project

    ADP8 is an open-source initiative that invites all users and contributors who treat others with respect.

    We will not tolerate any discrimination based on race, gender, religion, nationality, or political beliefs.

    Please engage with kindness and respect. Being (supposedly) right doesn't give you the right to be an asshole.

    Harassment and bullying are strictly prohibited. Again, don't be an asshole.
